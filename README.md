# My program keeps things confidential by using AES encryption, so only someone with the right password can actually read the message. To make sure the message isn’t changed, I hash it with SHA-256 before encrypting and then hash it again after decrypting to check that both hashes match, and AES-GCM also warns if anything was tampered with. It’s also easy to run and doesn’t require anything complicated, so it stays available for whoever needs to use it. The random salt and nonce give the program good entropy so the encryption isn’t predictable, and PBKDF2 turns the password into a strong key, which makes the whole process more secure.
